# videogen-dataset_toolkit
Simple Python GUI for curating video datasets, as I couldn't find software that can delete videos while streaming them, so I made a simple one.

## Features
- Play a list of videos from a folder
- Delete videos while streaming and immediately play the next video
- Basic Video Player features:
  - Next and previous video from the list
  - Rewatch the video
  - And of course, delete video (not a basic feature though)
- Can select a folder.

## Installation
```bash
# Only requires 2 things, Python and VLC Media Player, any Python >3.10 should work.
git clone https://github.com/saikanov/videogen-dataset_curation_gui
Go to the videogen-dataset_curation_gui folder
Run the install.bat
After installation, next time you run it, just use the run.bat
I don't make a Linux version, if you use Linux you should know how to use this GUI though.
```
