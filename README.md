# videogen-dataset_toolkit
Simple python GUI for curate video dataset, because i cant find a software that can delete the video while streaming it, so i make simple one.

## Features
- Play list of video from a folder
- Delete video while streaming and immediately play the next video
- Basic Video Player features:
  - next and previous video from the list
  - rewatch the video
  - and for sure delete video (not basic tho)
- Can select folder.

## Installation
```bash
# only need 2 things, Python and VLC Media Player, any Python >3.10 should work.
git clone https://github.com/saikanov/videogen-dataset_curation_gui

go to videogen-dataset_curation_gui folder

hit the install.bat

after installed, next time you run it, just use run.bat

i dont make linux version, if you use linux you should have know how to use this gui tho.
```
